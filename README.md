## How to test it

The Maven build script provides hooks for run unit tests and generate code coverage
reports in HTML.

To run tests on all tiers together do this:

1. Execute `mvn clean test jacoco:report`
2. Open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/index.html`

To run tests on a single tier do this:

1. Execute `mvn clean test-compile surefire:test@tier jacoco:report@tier` where `tier` is one of `controller`, `model`, `persistence`
2. Open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/{controller, model, persistence}/index.html`

To run tests on all the tiers in isolation do this:

1. Execute `mvn exec:exec@tests-and-coverage`
2. To view the Controller tier tests open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/model/index.html`
3. To view the Model tier tests open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/model/index.html`
4. To view the Persistence tier tests open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/model/index.html`

\*(Consider using `mvn clean verify` to attest you have reached the target threshold for coverage)
